Planning
========
This is the planning document for the development of the Jas assembler. This document
will be updated as the project progresses.

Encoding instructions
---------------------
The first step in the development of the Jas assembler is to encode the instructions
into binary. This will be done by creating a `struct` for each encoding entry and it's
information. The encoding entries can be found on the intel developers PDF document.
As shown below:

instruction: [Instruction `enum` value]
operand1: [Operand 1 `enum` type]
operandSize1: [Operand 1 size]
operand2: [Operand 2 `enum` type]
operandSize2: [Operand 2 size]
operand3: [Operand 3 `enum` type]
operandSize3: [Operand 3 size]
operand4: [Operand 4 `enum` type]
operandSize4: [Operand 4 size]
opcode: [Opcode of instruction]

Then, the instructions are matched and encoded.
