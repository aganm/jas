| -------- | ------- |

This is the official source tree for the Jas assembler. Jas is a MIT licensed, free and open-source x86 assembler capable of generating ELF files designed to run on on linux systems. Please note that this is an exprimetal project designed to be a educational project for myself and others to study and use. By no means is it ready for production enviroments at this stage, no warranty of any kind is provided as outlined in the license.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Motivation
Assemblers are heavy duty software normally written by those people who know their stuff, the Jas project aims to be a open-source assembler that's not just limited to compiling code into machine code, but to educate "Noobs" like me on the vast world of assembly language and assembler encodings. We will always aim to be as transparent and open as possible to the world! 

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing
For developers interested and passionate about assemblers and low-level programming, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/a02fea10d9d398ef63a9fc9419ce54d8b406c3a5/CONTRIBUTING.txt) in the home directory for more information on how to contribute code to the repository! No matter how big or small your changes are, you're in for a treat!

### üìù Licensing
