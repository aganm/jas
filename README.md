| -------- | ------- |

This is the official source tree for the Jas assembler. Jas is a minimalist, MIT licensed x86/64 assembler capable of generating ELF files designed to run on on linux systems.

Assemblers are heavy duty software normally written by those people who know their stuff, the Jas project aims to be a open-source assembler that's not just limited to compiling code into machine code, but to educate novices like me on the vast world of assembly language and assembler encodings. We will always aim to be as transparent and open as possible to the world! 

### üìù Licensing 
All the code under the Jas assembler project repository is licensed under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) which is a popular open-source license for projects like this! Please see [LICENSE](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/main/LICENSE) for the details.

*No warranty of any kind is provided, please double check offical sources before deploying code to production*

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing / Security issues
No software is perfect, nor is Jas. As the assembler is written in C, many secuity issues may arise, causing issues across the program. It's a shared responsibility to safeguard Jas of all developers, contributers and users alike. Please report all secuity concerns in a timely manner via email or the means provided [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/dev/SECURITY.md). 

However, for developers interested and passionate about assemblers and low-level programming, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/a02fea10d9d398ef63a9fc9419ce54d8b406c3a5/CONTRIBUTING.txt) in the home directory for more information on how to contribute code to the repository! 

All changes and reports are welcome, no matter how big or small your changes are :-)

### üìÉ Going deeper
For the developers, users and even "randos" on the internet who wants to learn more about the Jas assembler, x86 assembly or even the basics of computer science; for the people who just want to go beyond simply using an assembler, we have written a comprehensive guide, explaining the ins and outs of the assembler and how an assembler is written [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/44aac9cb3f99ec6ab401f9bb2a2e6a2155d05bc0/LEARN.md)

### ü§ù Respect and commmunity conduct 
Jas and its members respect and welcome all developers regardless of age, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. No tolerence will be given to any discriminative or disrespectful behaviour. See [here for more information](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
