| -------- | ------- |

This is the official source tree for the Jas assembler. Jas is a MIT licensed, free and open-source x86 assembler capable of generating ELF files designed to run on on linux systems. Please note that this is an experimental project designed to be a educational project for myself and others to study and use. I want this assembler to be a programable system that allows people to whip up their own compilers and generate executable x86 code without self-developing their little assemblers.

### üìù Licensing 
All the code under the Jas assembler project repository is licensed under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) which is a popular open-source license for projects like this! Please see [LICENSE](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/main/LICENSE) for the details.

*No warranty of any kind is provided, please double check offical sources before deploying code to production*

### ‚òùÔ∏è Motivation
Assemblers are heavy duty software normally written by those people who know their stuff, the Jas project aims to be a open-source assembler that's not just limited to compiling code into machine code, but to educate novices like me on the vast world of assembly language and assembler encodings. We will always aim to be as transparent and open as possible to the world! 

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing
For developers interested and passionate about assemblers and low-level programming, please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/a02fea10d9d398ef63a9fc9419ce54d8b406c3a5/CONTRIBUTING.txt) in the home directory for more information on how to contribute code to the repository! No matter how big or small your changes are, you're in for a treat!

### üìÉ Going deeper
For the developers, users and even randos on the internet who wants to learn more about the Jas assembler, x86 assembly or even the basics of computer science; for the people who just want to go beyond simply using an assembler, we have written a comprehensive guide, explaining the ins and outs of the assembler and how an assembler is written [here](https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas/blob/44aac9cb3f99ec6ab401f9bb2a2e6a2155d05bc0/LEARN.md)
